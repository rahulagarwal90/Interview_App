## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Camera/Microphone Access Denied**
   - Check browser permissions
   - Ensure HTTPS in production
   - Try different browser

2. **Email Not Sending**
   - Verify Gmail app password
   - Check SMTP settings
   - Ensure 2FA is enabled

3. **Questions Not Loading**
   - Check question file format
   - Verify role name matches file name
   - Ensure JSON syntax is valid

4. **Recording Issues**
   - Use Chrome on desktop for best MediaRecorder support
   - Ensure HTTPS in production for getUserMedia
   - Microphone tips:
     - Check OS/browser mic permissions and input device
     - Close other apps using the mic
     - Our app requests audio with echoCancellation, noiseSuppression, autoGainControl

### Browser Compatibility
- **Recommended**: Chrome 80+, Firefox 75+
- **Required Features**: MediaRecorder API, WebRTC, Fullscreen API
- **Mobile**: Limited support (desktop recommended)

## Production Deployment

### Environment Setup
1. Set `NODE_ENV=production`
2. Use HTTPS for secure media access
3. Configure proper SMTP settings
4. Set strong JWT secret
5. Enable file compression

### Scaling Considerations
- Use database instead of in-memory storage
- Implement Redis for session management
- Add load balancing for multiple instances
- Use cloud storage for recordings

## Render Deployment Guide (Free Tier)

This project is designed to be deployed as a single Node/Express service on Render. The free tier is suitable for prototypes and small usage. Cold starts (20‚Äì50s) can occur after inactivity.

### 1) Prerequisites
- GitHub repository containing this app
- Gmail App Password (2FA enabled) for SMTP

### 2) Environment Variables (Render ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment)
Set the following variables (values shown are examples). Prefer SendGrid on Render:

```
NODE_ENV=production
# Recommended on Render
SENDGRID_API_KEY=replace-with-sendgrid-api-key
SENDGRID_FROM=verified-sender@example.com
RECRUITER_EMAIL=recipient@example.com
JWT_SECRET=replace-with-a-long-random-string
RECORDINGS_PATH=/opt/render/project/src/recordings
RESULTS_PATH=/opt/render/project/src/results
APP_URL=TEMP_PLACEHOLDER
```

Notes:
- `APP_URL` will be updated to your Render URL after the first successful deploy.
- `RECORDINGS_PATH` and `RESULTS_PATH` match the mount points you will create for persistent disks.
- If you use SMTP on Render, Gmail may time out or be blocked on free tier. Prefer SendGrid.

### 3) Create the Web Service
1. Go to https://render.com ‚Üí New ‚Üí Web Service
2. Select your repo
3. Configure:
   - Name: `interview-app` (or any unique name)
   - Runtime: Node
   - Build Command: `npm install`
   - Start Command: `node server.js`
   - Instance Type: Free
4. Add the Environment Variables from step 2
5. Create Web Service and wait for deploy to finish

### 4) Add Persistent Disks (Recommended)
Persistent disks keep uploaded recordings and generated result files across restarts.

- Create Disk A:
  - Mount Path: `/opt/render/project/src/recordings`
  - Size: 1‚Äì2 GB (depending on expected video volume)

- Create Disk B:
  - Mount Path: `/opt/render/project/src/results`
  - Size: 100‚Äì500 MB

The application reads these paths from the env vars `RECORDINGS_PATH` and `RESULTS_PATH` set above. No code change is needed.

#### Deploying WITHOUT Persistent Disks (Free-only setup)
- You can skip adding disks. In that case, files are stored on the ephemeral filesystem.
- What this means:
  - Files persist while the instance is running.
  - Files are lost on redeploys, restarts, or when Render free dyno sleeps.
- Recommended adjustments if you skip disks:
  - Keep email notifications enabled (you still receive the results summary via email).
  - Consider lowering recording size or disabling recordings for production use on free tier.
  - If you need durable storage later, switch to a cloud bucket (e.g., S3 free tier) or enable Render persistent disks and set `RECORDINGS_PATH`/`RESULTS_PATH` accordingly.

### 5) Set APP_URL and Redeploy
After the first deploy, Render will assign a URL like `https://your-service.onrender.com`.

- Update `APP_URL` to this value in Render ‚Üí Environment
- Save ‚Üí Trigger a Redeploy

This value is used when generating secure interview links that are emailed to candidates.

### 6) Post-Deploy Smoke Tests
Perform these checks from an Incognito browser:

- **Home/Admin**: Open `https://your-service.onrender.com/`
- **Generate link**: Use the admin panel to send yourself an invite
- **Interview start (rules screen)**:
  - Setup screen shows rules and a Start button
  - Start button enables when camera/mic and questions are ready
  - Click Start ‚Üí timer shows 60:00 and first question loads
- **Anti-cheat**:
  - Switch tabs; after 5 seconds the interview should auto-submit
- **Submit flow**:
  - On last question, click Submit
  - Buttons disable; submission succeeds
  - Redirect to `/thank-you.html`
  - Email arrives at `RECRUITER_EMAIL`
- **Files**:
  - Confirm files saved under mounted paths (`/recordings` and `/results`)

### 7) Free Tier Limitations
### 8) Troubleshooting on Render
- **Emails not sending**:
  - Preferred: use SendGrid (`SENDGRID_API_KEY`, `SENDGRID_FROM` with verified sender)
  - If using SMTP: confirm `EMAIL_USER`, `EMAIL_PASS` (App Password), and logs show success
  - Check spam/promotions in recipient mailbox
- **Recording issues**: Verify browser supports MediaRecorder (Chrome is recommended). Ensure HTTPS.
- **Links invalid**: Ensure `APP_URL` matches your Render URL and that tokens haven‚Äôt expired.
- **Files missing after restart**: Verify Persistent Disks are mounted to the same paths as in env vars.
  - If you deployed without disks, this is expected on redeploy or cold start. Use a bucket (S3) or enable disks for durability.
## Gmail App Password: Detailed Steps

To use Gmail SMTP you must use an App Password (not your normal password).

1. Enable 2-Step Verification on your Google Account.
2. Go to Google Account ‚Üí Security ‚Üí App passwords.
3. Select App: ‚ÄúMail‚Äù, Device: ‚ÄúOther (Custom name)‚Äù (e.g., ‚ÄúInterview App‚Äù).
4. Generate. Copy the 16-character password.
5. Set it in your environment as `EMAIL_PASS` both locally and on Render.
6. Keep `EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com` and `EMAIL_PORT=587`.
7. If sending volume increases or Gmail throttles, consider a transactional email provider (Mailgun/SendGrid free tiers).
